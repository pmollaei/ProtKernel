** Chignolin **

The Chignolin.pdb is the protein structure provided for simulations in [1]. We used it to generate the basic structure of the protein using VMD: Chignolin_reference.pdb. The standard residues have been retained (resid 2 to 9) for our analysis. The generated protein is also rotated to align the principal axis of it with the x,y,z axis.
